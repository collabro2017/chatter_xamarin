	<string name="faq_answer_1">Every user (and device) has a pair of keys, the one called public key is sent to the server and given to anyone that desires to communicate with that user. The private key is secured on the device and is only transferred when you pair another device. In essence a public key can lock a content (When sending a message) and a private key can unlock it (When receiving a message). The private key is also used for signing to verify the origin of the message.</string>
	<string name="faq_answer_10">Tap and hold the message, select \'Erase from this device\' to erase from the current device.\n\n* Tip: The option \'Take message back\' will remove the message from your contact\'s phone too!</string>
	<string name="faq_answer_2">A fingerprint is derived from a public key and can be used to compare two public keys (To check if they are the same). When you add a contact the server provides you their public key (And you derive that user’s fingerprint). Now let’s say you don’t trust us and want to make sure we didn’t changed the keys with our own (Which would give us access to all the messages). By scanning your friends fingerprint you will have a way to verify no one changed the keys and will be notified if someone does.</string>
	<string name="faq_answer_3">You can scan your friends fingerprint, this is not only an easy way to add you friends but also provides an offline way of verifying your friends identity. See \'What is a fingerprint\' for more info.</string>
	<string name="faq_answer_4">The lock means you haven\'t scanned your contact\'s fingerprint, doing so would increase the security of your conversation.\nThe alert icon means your contact got a new key after you scanned his fingerprint, this could mean the conversation was compromised or that your contact had to get a new key, if you see this icon you should verify your friends identity or rescan his fingerprint before sharing sensitive data.</string>
	<string name="faq_answer_5">Your device password will further lock down your device key, this will encrypt the local database with a key derived from that password. Without that password no one can access the data stored on that device.</string>
	<string name="faq_answer_6">This will delete any record of this account from the deviceand also notify the server that this device will no longer be used (Similar to deleting it).</string>
	<string name="faq_answer_7">Go to the devices tab, tap on the device you want to pair, and select pair.</string>
	<string name="faq_answer_8">This means your message did not send properly. Tap and hold the message to resend it.</string>
